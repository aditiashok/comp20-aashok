Is it possible to request the data from a different origin or from your
local machine using XMLHttpRequest?

No, it is not possible to request the data from a different origin using
XMLHttpRequest. This is due to the same-origin policy, which states that
content from one website is only allowed to read and modify content received
from the same website but can't access content receieved from different 
webistes. This is because of security reasons (i.e. you wouldn't want Facebook
to be allowed to access your online banking account).
