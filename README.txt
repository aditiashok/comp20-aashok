README / Lab 9

1. The two main purposes of this git repository were:
	- To allow Ming to be able to access our work to grade
	- To have a location to store all of our projects and easily retrieve 
	  them later

2. My favorite assignment Assignment 2, the Real Marauder's Map, because it
   was my first time using an external API, and I really enjoyed being able
   to quickly view the results of what I was coding. Assignment 1 was a
   close runner up because even though it was just basic HTML/CSS, I love
   design so I really enjoyed customizing a homepage for myself.

3. I think I have grown quite a bit. I'm not sure if I really enjoyed
   every single assignment -- the server/database portion was a bit more
   difficult for me and I'm not sure if that's something I want to go into,
   but I do know that I am much better at learning how to acquire the 
   resources I need to solve a problem, whether on the internet, through
   word of mouth, or something else.

4. The most important thing I learned in the course I think, like I mentioned
   above, was the ability to learn how to find information on my own. For 
   example, for the Marauder's Map project, I had to do research outside of 
   just the information provided in order to learn how to make my marker image
   unique, send data, and more. Similarly, in the most recent assignment, I had
   to do some research into what constitutes as a security vulnerability. Both 
   of these examples have been helpful in teaching me how to find the resources
   I need to solve a problem independently.

5. I really want to delve deeper into Frontend frameworks. Like I mentioned 
   earlier, I have always loved design but I also like coding and thinking
   more technically rather than drawing, so frontend development provides me
   with a good synthesis of both of these things. I will be working in iOS 
   development this summer and I'm hoping this gives me a chance to put some
   of these new skills to use!


Thanks Ming for an interesting and worthwhile semester. I look forward to 
applying everything I've learned to "real world" problems now!
